        <p>
        I am  a front-end developer located in Nairobi ,Kenya.I have serious passion for creating  attractive, user-friendly, easy to use and responsive designs
for websites,webapps and applications.My interest lies in the whole front-end spectrum and working on ambitious projects for creative and positive people.
This site is a place for me to showcase some of my projects. I am a well-organised person, an independent employee with high attention to detail which makes me an amazing problem-solver.
In terms of non-computer hobbies ,I am an outdoor person who loves travelling and exploring nature.I also fancy watching movies.My professional background may have taken many twists and turns from being a small business owner and entrepreneur to finally settling for code . As a web developer, I enjoy using my unequivocal 
love for making things, and my mission-driven work ethic to literally change the world. That's why I am excited to make a big impact at a high growth company.
